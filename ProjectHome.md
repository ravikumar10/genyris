Inspired by the Semantic Web, Genyris presents a new programming paradigm. Objects can belong to multiple classes independent from construction. Indentation reduces parentheses yet retains the power of Lisp. External Java libraries can be imported.
  * Objects can belong to multiple classes
  * Classes are assigned to objects after construction
  * Indentation syntax reduces parentheses
  * Use Java class libraries like Swing
  * 100% Java
